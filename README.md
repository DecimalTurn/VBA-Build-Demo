# VBA-Build-Demo

## How to use

To try the demo yourself, follow these steps:

- Create a new repo by clicking **`Use this template`** in the top-right corner of the screen (you can even make it private if you prefer).
- *(Optional)* Make edits to the VBA code located in `src/Modules/Module1.bas`.
- Start the workflow to build your workbook (see image below).

Once you’ve started the workflow, it may take a few seconds to appear on the page—you can refresh to see it show up. Click on it to view the progress. Note that the Office installation step takes about 5 minutes, so you might have just enough time to grab a coffee. When it's done, the Action will have committed the generated `.xlsm` file to the root of the repo with the name `skeleton.xlsm`.
