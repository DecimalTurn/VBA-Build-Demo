# VBA-Build-Demo

A demo template for [VBA-Build](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vba-build)

## How to use

To try the demo yourself, follow these steps:

- Create a new repo by clicking **`Use this template`** in the top-right corner of the screen (you can even make it private if you prefer).
- *(Optional)* Make edits to the VBA code located in `src/skeleton.xlsm/Modules/Module1.bas`.
- Start the workflow to build your workbook (see image below).

Once you’ve started the workflow, it may take a few seconds to appear on the page—you can refresh to see it show up. Click on it to view the progress. Note that the Office installation step takes about 5 minutes, so you might have just enough time to grab a coffee. When it's done, the Action will have generated and zip the Office Documents as a build artifact that can be downloaded.
